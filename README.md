# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars
### In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.
<hr>

The first step of this project was to create a Jupyter Notebook and use BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and Pandas to produce the scraping code. 
The code created in this first step was then transformed into a .py file to store all the scraped data into a python dictionary. 
After this data was stored, I created a Flask application to run my scrape code and store it in a database.
Finally, I created an HTML file to read and present the data stored in the database.

Please reference the screenshots below for the end result of this project.
